# Game Library and create-t3-app Playground

I'm using this as my personal playground for testing out things I find interested. It also serves as a Game Library, as I might have some fun making more games with various frameworks.

This is an app bootstrapped according to the [init.tips](https://init.tips) stack, also known as the T3-Stack.

## Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Next-Auth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

For additional information see [create-t3-app docs](https://create.t3.gg).

## Additional packages

### 3D

- [three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [react-three-fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction)

### Animation

- [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- [gsap](https://greensock.com/gsap/)

### Plans

- [ ] Build a game using react-three-fiber
- [ ] Build a game using three.js
- [ ] Complete the neo-brutalism components library and export it to a new project

Automatically deployed on vercel at [t3-games-estubmo](https://t3-games-estubmo.vercel.app/)
